% We are now, by default, starting an aggregator (see statman_app.erl).
% The normal way of running Statman would be to have one aggregator running 
% in your VM running Statman. Originally, it was designed so that you could
% start aggregator processes in a different VM and then add that process to
% another VM running Statman with statman_server:add_subscriber/2, but this
% is not a good approach as it does not follow OTP app principles.
